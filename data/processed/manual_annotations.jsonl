    "text": "A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. The blockage is usually due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process of plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis.\nSometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. A lack of blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\nA heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. Fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. The clot can block arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the tissue in the heart muscle to die.\nA heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction.\nPrompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.\nSymptoms of a heart attack vary. Some people have mild symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Some people have no symptoms.\nCommon heart attack symptoms include:\nWomen may have atypical symptoms such as brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm or back. Sometimes, the first symptom sign of a heart attack is sudden cardiac arrest.\nSome heart attacks strike suddenly. But many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. Chest pain or pressure (angina) that keeps happening and doesn't go away with rest may be an early warning sign. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.\nGet help right away if you think you're having a heart attack. Take these steps:\nTake aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack may reduce heart damage by preventing blood clotting.\nAspirin can interact with other drugs. Don't take an aspirin unless your care provider or emergency medical personnel say to do so. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.\nIf someone is unconscious and you think they're having a heart attack, first call 911 or your local emergency number. Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR .\nWe use the data you provide to deliver you the content you requested.

In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart (coronary) arteries are blocked. This is usually due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart.\nIf a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart.\nA heart attack may be caused by a complete or partial blockage of a heart (coronary) artery. One way to classify heart attacks is whether an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows some specific changes (ST elevation) that require emergency invasive treatment. Your health care provider may use ECG results to describe these types of heart attacks.\nNot all heart attacks are caused by blocked arteries. Other causes include:\nHeart attack risk factors include:\nHeart attack complications are often due to heart muscle damage. Potential complications of a heart attack include:\nIt's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack \u2014 even if you've already had one. Here are ways to prevent a heart attack.\nIt's also a good idea to learn Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) properly so you can help someone who's having a heart attack. Consider taking an accredited first-aid training course, including CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED).\nOct 09, 2023\nCON-20373087\nYour donation powers the future of medicine and helps save lives.",

They're more common in children than in adults.\nA person having an absence seizure may stare blankly into space for a few seconds. Then the person typically returns quickly to being alert. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. But injury can happen if someone is driving a car or riding a bike when the seizure happens.\nAbsence seizures usually can be managed with antiseizure medicines. Some children who have them also develop other seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens.\nA simple absence seizure causes a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a brief lapse in attention. The seizure lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 30 seconds. There's no confusion, headache or drowsiness after the seizure.\nSymptoms of absence seizures include:\nAfterward, there's usually no memory of the incident. But if the seizure is longer, the person may be aware of missed time. Some people have many episodes daily. When it happens, it can interfere with school or daily activities.\nA child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices them. This is because the seizures are so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of the seizure disorder.

    "text": "Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart. Heart disease includes:\nMany forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.\nHeart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease.\nCoronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls usually causes coronary artery disease. This buildup is called plaque. The buildup of plaque in the arteries is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or a stroke.\nSymptoms of coronary artery disease can include:\nYou might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, a stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms. Talk with your healthcare team about any concerns. Heart disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk.\n{Music playing}\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available.\nCoronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it.\nAnyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD.\nWhen coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing.\nDiagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan.\nTreating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.\nDiscovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease. If you'd like to learn even more about this condition, watch our other related videos or visit Mayoclinic.org. We wish you well.\nThe heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:\nA congenital heart defect is a heart condition present at birth. Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:\nSome congenital heart defects may not be found until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms may include:\nIn the beginning, cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition gets worse, symptoms may include:\nThe heart has four valves. The valves open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. If a heart valve is narrowed, it's called stenosis. If a heart valve lets blood flow backward, it's called regurgitation.\nSymptoms of heart valve disease depend on which valve isn't working right. Symptoms may include:\nGet emergency medical help if you have these heart disease symptoms:\nAlways call 911 or your local emergency number if you think you might be having a heart attack.\nIf you think you may have symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment for a health checkup.\nHeart disease is easier to treat when found early.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

There are many different types of heart disease.\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves are gates at the chamber openings. They keep blood flowing in the right direction.\nA typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves are gates at the chamber openings. They keep blood flowing in the right direction.\nTo understand the causes of heart disease, it may help to understand how the heart works.\nFour valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. These valves are:\nEach valve has flaps, called leaflets or cusps. The flaps open and close once during each heartbeat. If a valve flap doesn't open or close properly, less blood moves out of the heart to the rest of the body.\nThe heart's electrical system keeps the heart beating. The heart's electrical signals start in a group of cells at the top of the heart called the sinus node. They pass through a pathway between the upper and lower heart chambers called the atrioventricular (AV) node. The movement of the signals causes the heart to squeeze and pump blood.\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque. Plaque can cause an artery to become narrowed or blocked. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. Plaque and blood clots can reduce blood flow through an artery.\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque.

Risk factors include an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and smoking. Healthy-lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of atherosclerosis.\nCommon causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to them include:\nA congenital heart defect happens while a baby is growing in the womb. Healthcare professionals aren't sure exactly what causes most congenital heart defects.

    "text": "Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest, just behind the breastbone. It's sometimes accompanied by a bitter or acidic taste in the mouth. The pain is often worse after eating, in the evening, or when lying down or bending over.\nOccasional heartburn is common and no cause for alarm. Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn on their own with lifestyle changes and nonprescription medicines.\nHeartburn that is more frequent or interferes with your daily routine may be a symptom of a more serious condition that requires medical care.\nSymptoms of heartburn include:\nChest pain may be a symptom of a heart attack. Seek help right away if you have severe chest pain or pressure, especially when combined with pain in the arm or jaw or difficulty breathing.\nMake an appointment with a healthcare professional if:\nWe use the data you provide to deliver you the content you requested. To provide you with the most relevant and helpful information, we may combine your email and website data with other information we have about you. If you are a Mayo Clinic patient, we will only use your protected health information as outlined in our Notice of Privacy Practices. You may opt out of email communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email.\nHeartburn happens when stomach acid backs up into the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, called the esophagus.\nTypically, when food is swallowed, a band of muscle around the bottom of the esophagus, called the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes to allow food and liquid to flow down into the stomach. Then the muscle tightens again.\nIf the lower esophageal sphincter isn't working as it should, stomach acid can flow back up into the esophagus and cause heartburn. The acid reflux may be worse when you're bent over or lying down.\nAcid reflux happens when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus isn't working as it should, allowing stomach acid to back up into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn and other signs and symptoms. Frequent or constant reflux can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nCertain foods and drinks can trigger heartburn in some people, including:\nBeing overweight or pregnant also can increase your risk of experiencing heartburn.\nHeartburn that happens often and interferes with your routine is considered gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD treatment may require prescription medicines and, occasionally, surgery or other procedures. GERD can seriously damage your esophagus or lead to precancerous changes in the esophagus called Barrett's esophagus.\nSep 20, 2025\nCON-20373206\nYour GivingTuesday gift can go 2X as far.",

    "text": "Heatstroke is a condition caused by the body overheating. This usually happens because of exposure to high temperatures or physical activity in high temperatures for too long. There are a few stages of heat injury, and heatstroke is the most serious. It can happen if body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher. Heatstroke is most common in the summer months.\nHeatstroke needs emergency care. If it's not treated, heatstroke can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. This damage gets worse the longer treatment is delayed, which increases the risk of serious complications or death.\nHeatstroke symptoms include:\nIf you think a person may be experiencing heatstroke, seek immediate medical help. Call 911 or your local emergency services number.\nTake immediate action to cool the person with heatstroke while waiting for emergency treatment.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

People may be more susceptible to heat-related illness when they're exposed to a sudden increase in temperature, such as during an early-summer heat wave or travel to a hotter climate.\nLimit activity for at least several days to allow time to acclimate to the temperature change. However, there may still be an increased risk of heatstroke until a person experiences several weeks of higher temperatures.\nCertain medicines. Some medicines affect your body's ability to stay hydrated and respond to heat. Be especially careful in hot weather if you take medicines that narrow your blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate your blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid your body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics).\nStimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illegal stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine also make you more vulnerable to heatstroke.\nHeatstroke can result in a number of complications, depending on how long the body temperature is high. Serious complications include:\nHeatstroke is predictable and preventable. Take these steps to prevent heatstroke during hot weather:\nNever leave anyone in a parked car. This is a common cause of heat-related deaths in children. When a car is parked in the sun, the temperature in the car can rise 20 degrees Fahrenheit (more than 11 degrees Celsius) in 10 minutes.\nIt's not safe to leave a person in a parked car in warm or hot weather, even if the windows are cracked or the car is in shade. When your car is parked, keep it locked to prevent a child from getting inside.\nBe cautious if you're at increased risk. If you take medicines or have a condition that increases your risk of heat-related problems, avoid the heat and act quickly if you notice symptoms of overheating. If you participate in a strenuous sporting event or activity in hot weather, make sure there are medical services available in case of a heat emergency.\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

    "text": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. The body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells. But high levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of heart disease.\nWith high cholesterol, fats and other substances can build up in blood vessels called arteries. This buildup is called plaque. As more plaque forms over time, the arteries can become narrowed or clogged. That makes it hard for enough blood to flow through the arteries. Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot. The clot may cause a heart attack or stroke.\nHigh cholesterol can be inherited. That means it can pass from parents to children through genes. But high cholesterol often is the result of lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, not eating a balanced diet or consuming large amounts of saturated fat. You can make changes to help prevent it. And if you have high cholesterol, you can help lower it with a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medicine.\nHigh cholesterol has no symptoms. A blood test is the only way to find out if you have it.\nThe American Heart Association recommends that children get checked, also called screened, for high cholesterol once between ages 9 and 11. Screening may start earlier if a child has a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack or stroke. Screening also may start earlier if a child has conditions such as diabetes or obesity.\nThe next cholesterol screening is recommended for people between ages 17 and 21. After that, many adults get their cholesterol checked every 4 to 6 years. People who have health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes may need to get screened more often. So might those who take cholesterol-lowering medicine. Those who have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease also may need more-frequent screenings.\nIf your test results aren't within the desirable range, your healthcare professional might recommend more-frequent testing as well.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

The types are based on what the lipoprotein carries. They are:\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. LDL carries cholesterol particles throughout the body. \"Bad\" cholesterol builds up in the walls of arteries. This makes the arteries hard and narrow.\nWhen a gene change causes high cholesterol, the body has trouble removing LDL cholesterol from the blood. Or the body has trouble breaking down LDL cholesterol in the liver.\nMost often, a blood test to check cholesterol levels also measures a type of fat in the blood that is not a type of cholesterol, called triglycerides. Having a high triglyceride level also can raise the risk of heart disease. Lifestyle factors that you may be able to control play a role in triglyceride levels.\nRisk factors for high cholesterol levels include:\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque.

    "text": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV. HIV damages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. If HIV isn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to become AIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't get AIDS.\nHIV is spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI. HIV also is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreated HIV to spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.\nThere's no cure for HIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS more available in resource-poor countries.\nThe symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary depending on the person and the phase of infection.\nSome people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This stage may last a few days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms during this stage.\nPossible symptoms include:\nThese symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream, called viral load, is high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads to others more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.\nIn this stage of infection, HIV is still in the body and cells of the immune system, called white blood cells. But during this time, many people don't have symptoms or the infections that HIV can cause.\nThis stage can last for many years for people who aren't getting antiretroviral therapy, also called ART. Some people get more-severe disease much sooner.\nAs the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may get mild infections or long-term symptoms such as:\nBetter antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. Thanks to these lifesaving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't get AIDS. Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years.\nHaving AIDS means your immune system is very damaged. People with AIDS are more likely to develop diseases they wouldn't get if they had healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease.\nThe symptoms of some of these infections may include:\nIf you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.\nHIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.\nYou can have an HIV infection with few or no symptoms for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have a complication you get only if you have AIDS, such as a serious infection or cancer.\nYou can get infected with HIV if infected blood, semen or fluids from a vagina enter your body. This can happen when you:\nYou can't become infected with HIV through casual contact. That means you can't catch HIV or get AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.\nHIV isn't spread through air, water or insect bites. You can't get HIV by donating blood.\nAnyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can have HIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you:\nHIV infection weakens your immune system. The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers.\nToxoplasmosis. This infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools. The parasites then can spread to other animals and humans.\nToxoplasmosis can cause heart disease. Seizures happen when it spreads to the brain. And it can be fatal.\nThere's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.\nTo help prevent the spread of HIV:\nConsider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP. There are two PrEP medicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and one PrEP medicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude). PrEP can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk.\nPrEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex.\nCabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved PrEP that can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill.\nYour healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to prevent HIV only to people who don't already have HIV infection. You need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you take PrEP.\nYou need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against other STIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning PrEP therapy.\nUse treatment as prevention, also called TasP. If you have HIV, taking HIV medicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex.\nIf you use TasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups.\nUse a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break.\nDuring oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

    "text": "Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.\nHyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.\nSometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.\nThe main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.\nSometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition.\nSeek immediate medical attention if you have heavy sweating with dizziness, pain in the chest, throat, jaw, arms, shoulders or throat, or cold skin and a rapid pulse.\nSee your health care provider if:\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin.

Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.\nSweating is the body's mechanism to cool itself. The nervous system automatically triggers sweat glands when your body temperature rises. Sweating also occurs, especially on your palms, when you're nervous.\nPrimary hyperhidrosis is caused by faulty nerve signals that trigger eccrine sweat glands to become overactive. It usually affects the palms, soles, underarms and sometimes the face.\nThere is no medical cause for this type of hyperhidrosis. It can run in families.\nSecondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying medical condition or by taking certain medications, such as pain relievers, antidepressants, and some diabetes and hormonal medications. This type of hyperhidrosis may cause sweating all over the body.

    "text": "Meningitis is an infection and swelling, called inflammation, of the fluid and membranes around the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called meninges.\nThe inflammation from meningitis most often triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck.\nViral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States. Bacteria, parasites and fungi also can cause it. Sometimes meningitis improves in a few weeks without treatment. But meningitis also can cause death. It often needs quick treatment with antibiotics.\nSeek medical care right away if you think that you or someone in your family has meningitis. For meningitis caused by bacteria, early treatment can prevent serious complications.\nEarly meningitis symptoms may be like those of the flu. Symptoms may come on over several hours or over a few days.\nThe following may be symptoms of meningitis in people older than 2 years:\nThe following may be symptoms of meningitis in newborns and infants:\nSeek medical care right away if you or someone in your family has meningitis symptoms such as:\nBacterial meningitis can cause death within days without fast antibiotic treatment. Delayed treatment also increases the risk of long-term brain damage.\nTalk with your healthcare professional if you've been near someone with meningitis. That may be a family member or someone you live or work with. You may need to take medicines to prevent getting an infection.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

The three membranes are called meninges. The tough outer membrane is called the dura mater, and the delicate inner layer is the pia mater.\nMeningitis is an infection and swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the fluid and three membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord. The three membranes are called meninges. The tough outer membrane is called the dura mater, and the delicate inner layer is the pia mater.\nViral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States, followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections. Because bacterial infections can lead to death, finding the cause is vital.\nGerms that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause bacterial meningitis. But bacterial meningitis also can happen when bacteria directly enter the meninges. This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection or a skull fracture. Rarely, some surgeries can cause it.\nSeveral strains of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. The most common are:\nNeisseria meningitidis. This germ causes a bacterial meningitis called meningococcal meningitis. These germs most often cause an upper respiratory infection. But they can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream.\nThis is an easy-to-catch infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults. It may cause local outbreaks in college dorms, boarding schools and military bases.\nA vaccine can help prevent infection. Even if vaccinated, anybody who has been in close contact with a person with meningococcal meningitis should get an oral antibiotic. This can help prevent the disease.\nViral meningitis is most often mild and clears on its own. A group of viruses known as enteroviruses is most often the cause in the United States. Enteroviruses are most common in late summer and early fall. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps virus, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis.\nChronic meningitis is meningitis whose symptoms last at least four weeks without letup. There are many causes of chronic meningitis. Symptoms can be like those of new-onset meningitis. But they come on slower and last longer. Symptoms may include headache, fever, vomiting and brain fog.\nFungal meningitis isn't common in the United States. It may act like bacterial meningitis. But symptoms may start slower and build over time. Breathing in fungal spores found in soil, decaying wood and bird droppings can be the cause.\nFungal meningitis doesn't spread from person to person. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease. It affects people with weakened immune systems, such as from AIDS. It can cause death if not treated with an antifungal medicine. Even with treatment, fungal meningitis may come back.\nThis type of meningitis is a rare complication of tuberculosis, also called TB. But it can be serious. Like fungal meningitis, its symptoms can start slowly and build up over days to weeks. Tuberculosis passes easily from person to person. Tuberculous meningitis needs treatment with TB medicines.\nParasites can cause a rare type of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis. A tapeworm infection in the brain or cerebral malaria also can cause parasitic meningitis. Amoebic meningitis is a rare type that sometimes comes from swimming in fresh water. It can quickly become life-threatening.\nThe main parasites that cause meningitis most often infect animals. People can get infected by eating foods that have these parasites. Parasitic meningitis isn't spread from person to person.\nCauses of meningitis that aren't infections include chemical reactions, medicines, allergies, some types of cancer and diseases such as sarcoidosis.\nRisk factors for meningitis include:\nMeningitis complications can be serious. The longer someone has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and long-term nervous system damage. Damage can include:\nCommon germs that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing or kissing. Germs also can spread by shared eating utensils, toothbrushes or cigarettes.\nThese steps can help prevent meningitis:\nVaccinations can help prevent some forms of bacterial meningitis. Vaccinations include:\nPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. This vaccine also is called PPSV23. Older children and adults who need protection from pneumococcal germs might get this vaccine. The CDC suggests the PPSV23 vaccine for all adults older than 65.\nIt's also for younger adults and children ages 2 and older who have weak immune systems or ongoing illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes or sickle cell anemia. And it's for anyone who doesn't have a spleen.\nMeningococcal conjugate vaccine. This vaccine also is called MenACWY. The CDC suggests giving a single dose of MenACWY to children ages 11 to 12, with a booster shot given at age 16. Children who get the first vaccine between ages 13 and 15 can have the booster between ages 16 and 18. Those who get the first shot at age 16 or older don't need a booster.\nChildren between the ages of 2 months and 10 years who are at high risk of bacterial meningitis can get this vaccine. So can children in this age range who have been around someone with the disease. It's also a vaccine for people who haven't been vaccinated who have been exposed to meningitis but aren't sick.\nSerogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB). The CDC suggests this vaccine for adults and children 10 years and older who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. They include adults and children with sickle cell disease, those who have a damaged spleen or those who have had their spleen removed.\nThis vaccine also is for people with the rare immune disorder called complement component deficiency or who take certain medicines. People who are exposed to an outbreak of serogroup B meningococcal disease also might get this vaccine.\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

    "text": "Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs. The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria. Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs. Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with typical immune systems. Medicines called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments. When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage. Primary TB infection. The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply. Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as: Latent TB infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection. Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include: Active TB disease outside the lungs. TB infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms may include: Active TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms more like disease in the lungs. Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include: Active TB disease in children. Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following: The symptoms of tuberculosis are similar to symptoms of many different illnesses.

People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets. The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings. A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking medicine to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Some forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that medicines that once cured the disease no longer work. This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality that makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does survive, then it can multiply. When antibiotic medicines aren't used correctly \u2014 or medicines fail to clear out all the bacteria for another reason \u2014 the conditions are ideal for more-resistant versions of the bacteria to take hold and multiply. If these bacteria are passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time. Problems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the following: Anyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting an infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active TB disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people who have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have one or more of the following risk factors. Certain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass from one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB infection: A weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include: The risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age. If you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take medicines to prevent active TB disease. If you have active TB disease, you'll need to take steps to prevent other people from getting an infection. You will take medicines for four, six or nine months. Take all of the medicines as directed during the entire time. During the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others. Protect others with these steps: In countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers who are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely in the United States. Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of development and testing.
