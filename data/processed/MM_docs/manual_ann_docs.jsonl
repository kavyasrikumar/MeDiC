{"document_id": "sample_doc_001", "text": "A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. The blockage is usually due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process of plaque buildup is called atherosclerosis.\nSometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. A lack of blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.\nA heart attack occurs when an artery that sends blood and oxygen to the heart is blocked. Fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. The clot can block arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, a lack of blood flow causes the tissue in the heart muscle to die.\nA heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction.\nPrompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.\nSymptoms of a heart attack vary. Some people have mild symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Some people have no symptoms.\nCommon heart attack symptoms include:\nWomen may have atypical symptoms such as brief or sharp pain felt in the neck, arm or back. Sometimes, the first symptom sign of a heart attack is sudden cardiac arrest.\nSome heart attacks strike suddenly. But many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. Chest pain or pressure (angina) that keeps happening and doesn't go away with rest may be an early warning sign. Angina is caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the heart.\nGet help right away if you think you're having a heart attack. Take these steps:\nTake aspirin, if recommended. Taking aspirin during a heart attack may reduce heart damage by preventing blood clotting.\nAspirin can interact with other drugs. Don't take an aspirin unless your care provider or emergency medical personnel say to do so. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.\nIf someone is unconscious and you think they're having a heart attack, first call 911 or your local emergency number. Then check if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person isn't breathing or you don't find a pulse, only then should you begin CPR .\nWe use the data you provide to deliver you the content you requested.

In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart (coronary) arteries are blocked. This is usually due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart.\nIf a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart.\nA heart attack may be caused by a complete or partial blockage of a heart (coronary) artery. One way to classify heart attacks is whether an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows some specific changes (ST elevation) that require emergency invasive treatment. Your health care provider may use ECG results to describe these types of heart attacks.\nNot all heart attacks are caused by blocked arteries. Other causes include:\nHeart attack risk factors include:\nHeart attack complications are often due to heart muscle damage. Potential complications of a heart attack include:\nIt's never too late to take steps to prevent a heart attack — even if you've already had one. Here are ways to prevent a heart attack.\nIt's also a good idea to learn Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) properly so you can help someone who's having a heart attack. Consider taking an accredited first-aid training course, including CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED).\nOct 09, 2023\nCON-20373087\nYour donation powers the future of
