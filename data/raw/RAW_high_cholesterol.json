  "text": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. The body needs cholesterol to build healthy cells. But high levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of heart disease.\nWith high cholesterol, fats and other substances can build up in blood vessels called arteries. This buildup is called plaque. As more plaque forms over time, the arteries can become narrowed or clogged. That makes it hard for enough blood to flow through the arteries. Sometimes a piece of plaque can break loose and form a blood clot. The clot may cause a heart attack or stroke.\nHigh cholesterol can be inherited. That means it can pass from parents to children through genes. But high cholesterol often is the result of lifestyle choices such as not getting enough exercise, not eating a balanced diet or consuming large amounts of saturated fat. You can make changes to help prevent it. And if you have high cholesterol, you can help lower it with a healthy diet, regular exercise and sometimes medicine.\nHigh cholesterol has no symptoms. A blood test is the only way to find out if you have it.\nThe American Heart Association recommends that children get checked, also called screened, for high cholesterol once between ages 9 and 11. Screening may start earlier if a child has a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack or stroke. Screening also may start earlier if a child has conditions such as diabetes or obesity.\nThe next cholesterol screening is recommended for people between ages 17 and 21. After that, many adults get their cholesterol checked every 4 to 6 years. People who have health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes may need to get screened more often. So might those who take cholesterol-lowering medicine. Those who have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease also may need more-frequent screenings.\nIf your test results aren't within the desirable range, your healthcare professional might recommend more-frequent testing as well.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

These factors include eating a diet high in saturated and trans fats and not getting enough exercise.\nSometimes factors that aren't within your control can lead to high cholesterol. These include gene changes that pass from parents to children, some health conditions, and some medicines.\nConditions that can cause high cholesterol include:\nSome types of medicines taken for other health conditions also can make cholesterol levels worse. These include treatments for:\nCholesterol travels through the blood, attached to proteins. This mix of proteins and cholesterol is called a lipoprotein. There are various types of cholesterol. The types are based on what the lipoprotein carries. They are:\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is known as the \"bad\" cholesterol. LDL carries cholesterol particles throughout the body. \"Bad\" cholesterol builds up in the walls of arteries. This makes the arteries hard and narrow.\nWhen a gene change causes high cholesterol, the body has trouble removing LDL cholesterol from the blood. Or the body has trouble breaking down LDL cholesterol in the liver.\nMost often, a blood test to check cholesterol levels also measures a type of fat in the blood that is not a type of cholesterol, called triglycerides. Having a high triglyceride level also can raise the risk of heart disease. Lifestyle factors that you may be able to control play a role in triglyceride levels.\nRisk factors for high cholesterol levels include:\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque. Plaque can cause an artery to become narrowed or blocked. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. Plaque and blood clots can reduce blood flow through an artery.\nIf there's too much cholesterol in the blood, the cholesterol and other substances may form deposits called plaque. Plaque can cause an artery to become narrowed or blocked. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form. Plaque and blood clots can reduce blood flow through an artery.\nHigh cholesterol can lead to other health conditions called complications. With high cholesterol, a dangerous amount of plaque can build up on the walls of arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Over time, the plaque buildup can cause arteries to narrow and block blood flow. Less blood flow through the arteries can cause complications such as:\nThe same heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can lower cholesterol also can help prevent high cholesterol.
