  "text": "Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest, just behind the breastbone. It's sometimes accompanied by a bitter or acidic taste in the mouth. The pain is often worse after eating, in the evening, or when lying down or bending over.\nOccasional heartburn is common and no cause for alarm. Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn on their own with lifestyle changes and nonprescription medicines.\nHeartburn that is more frequent or interferes with your daily routine may be a symptom of a more serious condition that requires medical care.\nSymptoms of heartburn include:\nChest pain may be a symptom of a heart attack. Seek help right away if you have severe chest pain or pressure, especially when combined with pain in the arm or jaw or difficulty breathing.\nMake an appointment with a healthcare professional if:\nWe use the data you provide to deliver you the content you requested.

Then the muscle tightens again.\nIf the lower esophageal sphincter isn't working as it should, stomach acid can flow back up into the esophagus and cause heartburn. The acid reflux may be worse when you're bent over or lying down.\nAcid reflux happens when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of your esophagus isn't working as it should, allowing stomach acid to back up into your esophagus. This can cause heartburn and other signs and symptoms. Frequent or constant reflux can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\nCertain foods and drinks can trigger heartburn in some people, including:\nBeing overweight or pregnant also can increase your risk of experiencing heartburn.\nHeartburn that happens often and interferes with your routine is considered gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD treatment may require prescription medicines and, occasionally, surgery or other procedures. GERD can seriously damage your esophagus or lead to precancerous changes in the esophagus called Barrett's esophagus.\nSep 20, 2025\nCON-20373206\nYour GivingTuesday gift can go 2X as far.",
