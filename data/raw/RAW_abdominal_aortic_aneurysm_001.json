The aorta goes from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen.\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding.\nTreatment depends on how big the aneurysm is and how fast it's growing. Treatment may include regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. You might not notice any symptoms. This makes them hard to find. Many start small and stay small. Others get bigger over time, sometimes quickly. Some aneurysms never rupture.\nIf you have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that's getting bigger, symptoms might include:\nIf you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and very bad, get medical help right away.\nThere is a problem with\ninformation submitted for this request.

Most aortic aneurysms happen in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen.\nThings that can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm include:\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:\nIf you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.\nPossible complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include:\nA rupture can cause life-threatening bleeding inside the body. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture.\nSymptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include:\nAortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.\nTo prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, take these steps:\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm care at Mayo Clinic\n63 Replies\nThu, Nov 20, 2025\n50 Replies\nSat, Nov 15, 2025\n33 Replies\nFri, Nov 14, 2025\nMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
